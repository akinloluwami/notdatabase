### NotDatabase

The easiest schema-based key-value database.

#### About the Project

**NotDatabase** is a developer-first database toolkit. It gives you a fully type-safe SDK and a simple API to work with structured key-value data. You define your collections with a schema, and NotDatabase handles the rest — validation, constraints, and storage.

No migrations. No heavy queries. Just fast, schema-driven persistence.

It’s great for:

- MVPs and internal tools
- Event logs, audit trails, or analytics
- Prototyping with real data
- Lightweight app backends

#### Why NotDatabase?

SQL is powerful — but can be overkill.  
NoSQL is fast — but often unstructured.  
**NotDatabase** hits the sweet spot: structured JSON documents and a simple SDK.

Built for hackers tired of setting up Postgres for simple projects.
